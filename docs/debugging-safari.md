# Safari Debug Logging Solution

## Overview

This document describes the Safari-compatible debug logging solution implemented to fix issues with console methods being undefined or stripped in Safari production mode.

## The Problem

Safari in production mode often has issues with console methods:
- Console methods may be undefined or stripped during optimization
- Direct calls to `console.log`, `console.error`, etc. can fail silently
- This makes debugging production issues on Safari extremely difficult

## The Solution

We've implemented a robust, Safari-compatible logger utility that:

### 1. **Logger Utility** (`/lib/logger.ts`)
- Ensures console methods exist before calling them
- Provides fallback to localStorage for persistent debugging
- Handles all edge cases where console might fail
- Supports different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Stores logs in memory and localStorage for later retrieval

### 2. **Debug Panel Component** (`/components/DebugPanel.tsx`)
- Visual debugging interface accessible in the browser
- Shows all logged messages with timestamps
- Allows exporting logs as JSON for analysis
- Only visible in development or when `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true`
- Accessible via a floating debug button in the bottom-right corner

### 3. **Integration**
- Logger is imported and used throughout the codebase
- Replaces all direct `console.*` calls with `logger.*` calls
- Debug panel is included in the root layout for global access

## Usage

### Basic Logging

```typescript
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger'

// Different log levels
logger.debug('Debug message', { additionalData: 'value' })
logger.info('Information message')
logger.warn('Warning message')
logger.error('Error message', error)
```

### Enabling Debug Mode in Production

Set the environment variable:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true
```

This will:
- Enable debug-level logging in production
- Show the debug panel button
- Store more detailed logs in localStorage

### Accessing Logs

1. **Via Debug Panel**: Click the üêõ Debug button in the bottom-right corner
2. **Via Console**: The logger still attempts to use console methods when available
3. **Via localStorage**: Logs are stored in `elevatus_logs` key
4. **Programmatically**:
   ```javascript
   // Get current logs
   const logs = logger.getLogs()
   
   // Get stored logs from localStorage
   const storedLogs = logger.getStoredLogs()
   
   // Export logs as JSON
   const jsonLogs = logger.exportLogs()
   ```

## Safari-Specific Features

1. **Console Method Validation**: Checks if console methods exist before use
2. **Fallback Storage**: Uses localStorage when console fails
3. **Error Resilience**: Continues working even if both console and localStorage fail
4. **No Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript implementation that works in all browsers

## Testing

To test the Safari fix:

1. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open Safari and navigate to the application

4. Enable debug mode by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true` in your environment

5. Check that:
   - No console errors appear
   - Debug panel shows logged messages
   - Logs persist in localStorage
   - Application functions normally

## Files Modified

- `/lib/logger.ts` - New logger utility
- `/components/DebugPanel.tsx` - New debug panel component
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Added debug panel to root layout
- `/app/auth/setup-password/page.tsx` - Replaced console calls with logger
- `/lib/email.ts` - Replaced console calls with logger
- `/lib/db.ts` - Replaced console calls with logger
- `.env.example` - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG variable

## Best Practices

1. Always use the logger instead of direct console calls
2. Use appropriate log levels (debug for development, info/warn/error for production)
3. Include relevant context data with log messages
4. Clear logs periodically to avoid localStorage bloat
5. Disable debug mode in production unless actively troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

If logs aren't appearing:

1. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true` is set for debug logs
2. Verify localStorage is enabled in Safari
3. Check the browser console for any error messages
4. Try exporting logs via the debug panel
5. Check localStorage directly: `localStorage.getItem('elevatus_logs')`
