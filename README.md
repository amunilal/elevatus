## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Coverage report
```

### Database Testing
Each PR gets its own isolated database branch for testing, ensuring:
- No test data pollution
- Safe schema changes
- Parallel development
- Clean environments

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Errors
If you see `password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'`:

1. **Check environment files**: The `.env.development.local` file (created by Vercel CLI) may be overriding local settings
   ```bash
   mv .env.development.local .env.development.local.backup
   ```

2. **Ensure Docker is running**: Start Docker Desktop and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Apply database schema**:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/elevatus_dev" npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Seed the database**:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/elevatus_dev" npm run db:seed
   ```

#### Port Conflicts
If port 3000 is in use:
- The app will automatically try port 3001
- Or manually kill the process: `lsof -i :3000` then `kill -9 <PID>`

#### Docker Issues
```bash
# Reset Docker services
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Environment Variables Not Loading
Ensure you're in the correct directory and the `.env.local` file exists:
```bash
pwd  # Should be /path/to/elevatus-tracker
ls -la .env*  # Should show .env.local
```
