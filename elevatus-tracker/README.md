## üîÑ GitHub Actions Workflow

### Automatic Database Branching
The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. **Creates database branch** for each pull request
2. **Runs migrations** on the branch database  
3. **Seeds test data** automatically
4. **Deploys preview** environment to Vercel
5. **Posts schema diff** comments on PRs
6. **Cleans up** database branch when PR is closed

### Required Secrets & Variables

#### Repository Variables
- `NEON_PROJECT_ID`: Your Neon project ID

#### Repository Secrets  
- `NEON_API_KEY`: Neon database API key
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel deployment token

- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Vercel project ID

### Workflow Features
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents multiple runs per PR
- **Schema Diff Comments**: Shows database changes in PR comments
- **Preview Environments**: Isolated database for each PR
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Database branches deleted when PR closes
- **Status Updates**: PR comments with deployment status

### Setting Up the Workflow

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Errors
If you see `password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'`:

1. **Check environment files**: The `.env.development.local` file (created by Vercel CLI) may be overriding local settings
   ```bash
   mv .env.development.local .env.development.local.backup
   ```

2. **Ensure Docker is running**: Start Docker Desktop and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Apply database schema**:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/elevatus_dev" npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Seed the database**:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/elevatus_dev" npm run db:seed
   ```

#### Port Conflicts
If port 3000 is in use:
- The app will automatically try port 3001
- Or manually kill the process: `lsof -i :3000` then `kill -9 <PID>`

#### Docker Issues
```bash
# Reset Docker services
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Environment Variables Not Loading
Ensure you're in the correct directory and the `.env.local` file exists:
```bash
pwd  # Should be /path/to/elevatus-tracker
ls -la .env*  # Should show .env.local
```
