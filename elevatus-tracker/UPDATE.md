## Priority Updates Required

### 1. Department-Position Relationship System

**Issue:** The employee creation form at `/employer/employees/new` needs hierarchical department-position dropdowns.

**Current State:**
- Department and Position are independent dropdown fields
- No relationship between department selection and available positions
- Manual entry required for positions

**Required Implementation:**

#### 1.1 Department-Position Data Structure
Create a hierarchical relationship where departments contain specific positions:

```typescript
interface DepartmentPosition {
  department: string;
  positions: string[];
}

const DEPARTMENT_POSITIONS: DepartmentPosition[] = [
  {
    department: "iOS",
    positions: ["Intern", "Junior Developer", "Developer", "Senior Developer"]
  },
  {
    department: "Android", 
    positions: ["Intern", "Junior Developer", "Developer", "Senior Developer"]
  },
  {
    department: "Frontend",
    positions: ["Intern", "Junior Developer", "Developer", "Senior Developer", "Lead Developer"]
  },
  {
    department: "Backend",
    positions: ["Intern", "Junior Developer", "Developer", "Senior Developer", "Lead Developer", "Architect"]
  },
  {
    department: "DevOps",
    positions: ["Junior Engineer", "Engineer", "Senior Engineer", "Lead Engineer"]
  },
  {
    department: "QA",
    positions: ["Junior Tester", "Tester", "Senior Tester", "QA Lead"]
  },
  {
    department: "Design",
    positions: ["Junior Designer", "Designer", "Senior Designer", "Lead Designer"]
  },
  {
    department: "Product",
    positions: ["Product Analyst", "Product Manager", "Senior Product Manager"]
  },
  {
    department: "HR",
    positions: ["HR Assistant", "HR Generalist", "HR Manager", "HR Director"]
  },
  {
    department: "Finance",
    positions: ["Accountant", "Financial Analyst", "Finance Manager", "CFO"]
  },
  {
    department: "Sales",
    positions: ["Sales Representative", "Senior Sales Rep", "Sales Manager", "Sales Director"]
  },
  {
    department: "Marketing",
    positions: ["Marketing Assistant", "Marketing Specialist", "Marketing Manager", "Marketing Director"]
  }
];
```

#### 1.2 Implementation Requirements

**Frontend Changes Required:**
1. **Update Employee Form Component** (`/app/employer/employees/new/page.tsx`)
   - Implement cascading dropdowns
   - Department selection clears and updates position options
   - Position dropdown disabled until department is selected
   - Smooth UX transitions between selections

2. **Form State Management**
   ```typescript
   const [selectedDepartment, setSelectedDepartment] = useState<string>('');
   const [availablePositions, setAvailablePositions] = useState<string[]>([]);
   const [selectedPosition, setSelectedPosition] = useState<string>('');

   // Update positions when department changes
   useEffect(() => {
     if (selectedDepartment) {
       const dept = DEPARTMENT_POSITIONS.find(d => d.department === selectedDepartment);
       setAvailablePositions(dept?.positions || []);
       setSelectedPosition(''); // Clear position when department changes
     } else {
       setAvailablePositions([]);
       setSelectedPosition('');
     }
   }, [selectedDepartment]);
   ```

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Add loading states during dropdown updates
   - Clear visual indication when position is reset
   - Proper form validation for both fields
   - Accessible labels and ARIA attributes

**Backend Changes Required:**
1. **Database Schema Updates** (if needed)
   - Ensure department-position combinations are validated
   - Add constraints to prevent invalid combinations

2. **API Validation**
   - Server-side validation of department-position pairs
   - Return appropriate error messages for invalid combinations

3. **Seed Data Updates**
   - Update seed data to use valid department-position combinations
   - Ensure existing employees have valid combinations

#### 1.3 User Experience Flow

1. **User selects Department:**
   - Department dropdown shows all available departments
   - Position dropdown is disabled and shows "Select department first"

2. **Department Selected:**
   - Position dropdown becomes enabled
   - Position dropdown populates with relevant positions only
   - Placeholder text changes to "Select position"

3. **Position Selected:**
   - Both values are validated
   - Form can proceed to next step or submission

4. **Department Changed:**
   - Position field is cleared
   - New positions are loaded
   - User must reselect position

#### 1.4 Technical Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Create Department-Position Configuration**
```typescript
// lib/departmentPositions.ts
export const DEPARTMENT_POSITIONS = [
  // Configuration as defined above
];

export const getDepartments = () => DEPARTMENT_POSITIONS.map(dp => dp.department);

export const getPositionsForDepartment = (department: string) => {
  const dept = DEPARTMENT_POSITIONS.find(dp => dp.department === department);
  return dept?.positions || [];
};

export const isValidDepartmentPosition = (department: string, position: string) => {
  const positions = getPositionsForDepartment(department);
  return positions.includes(position);
};
```

**Step 2: Update Form Component**
- Replace static dropdowns with dynamic cascading dropdowns
- Implement proper state management
- Add form validation

**Step 3: Update API Validation**
- Add server-side validation in employee creation endpoint
- Validate department-position combinations

**Step 4: Update Existing Data**
- Review existing employee data for invalid combinations
- Update seed data with valid combinations

### 2. Additional Form Enhancements

#### 2.1 Form Validation Improvements
- Real-time validation feedback
- Better error message display
- Required field indicators

#### 2.2 UX Improvements
- Auto-save draft functionality
- Form step indicators
- Better mobile responsiveness

## Database Updates Required

### Schema Modifications
```sql
-- Add index for department-position queries
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_dept_position ON employees(department, designation);

-- Add constraint to ensure valid combinations (optional)
-- This would require implementing a check constraint or trigger
```

### Seed Data Updates
```typescript
// Update prisma/seed.ts to use valid department-position combinations
const employees = [
  {
    department: "iOS",
    designation: "Senior Developer", // Must match DEPARTMENT_POSITIONS
    // ... other fields
  },
  // ... more employees with valid combinations
];
```
