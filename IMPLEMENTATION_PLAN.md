# Employee Tracker Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Product Name:** Employee Tracker (Catalyst Brand)  
**Technology:** Next.js 14+ with TypeScript  
**Timeline:** 15-16 weeks for MVP (includes enhanced Review module and Learning & Development)  
**Team Size:** 2-3 developers recommended  
**Target Market:** South African businesses  
**Localization:** South African metrics, currency (ZAR), and compliance  

## Dual Portal Architecture

### Portal Separation Strategy
The application will feature two distinct portals with separate authentication flows, UI/UX, and feature sets:

#### Employer Portal (/employer)
- **Access Level:** HR Admins, Managers, Super Admins
- **Features:** Full employee management, analytics, reports, system configuration
- **Design:** Professional, data-rich interface with advanced controls
- **Authentication:** Corporate SSO integration, 2FA mandatory

#### Employee Portal (/employee)
- **Access Level:** Individual employees
- **Features:** Personal profile, attendance, leave requests, performance reviews
- **Design:** Simple, mobile-first interface focused on daily tasks
- **Authentication:** Email/password with optional 2FA

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Time to interactive < 5 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users

### Security Requirements
- HTTPS everywhere
- Data encryption at rest
- Regular security audits
- POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act) compliance
- GDPR compliance for international employees
- Role-based access control
- Separate authentication tokens for employer/employee portals
- Session isolation between portals
- API rate limiting per portal type
- Data access logging and audit trails
- Local data residency requirements (South African servers)
- Biometric data protection per POPIA
- Employee consent management

### Scalability Plan
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Database read replicas
- Caching layer (Redis)
- CDN for static assets
- Microservices architecture (future)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Clear MVP definition and change management process

2. **Timeline Delays**
   - Mitigation: Buffer time and parallel development tracks

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Mitigation: Prioritized feature list and phased delivery
