# Employee Tracker Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Product Name:** Employee Tracker (Catalyst Brand)  
**Technology:** Next.js 14+ with TypeScript  
**Timeline:** 11-13 weeks for MVP (includes Learning & Development module)  
**Team Size:** 2-3 developers recommended  

## Dual Portal Architecture

### Portal Separation Strategy
The application will feature two distinct portals with separate authentication flows, UI/UX, and feature sets:

#### Employer Portal (/employer)
- **Access Level:** HR Admins, Managers, Super Admins
- **Features:** Full employee management, analytics, reports, system configuration
- **Design:** Professional, data-rich interface with advanced controls
- **Authentication:** Corporate SSO integration, 2FA mandatory

#### Employee Portal (/employee)
- **Access Level:** Individual employees
- **Features:** Personal profile, attendance, leave requests, performance reviews
- **Design:** Simple, mobile-first interface focused on daily tasks
- **Authentication:** Email/password with optional 2FA
